	   <p>	Donald E. Knuth was an early pioneer of the field of computer science
	     and has left a lasting legacy that continues to be felt to this day. His most
	     famous contribution and what he considers his most important work is the 
	     multi-volume Art of Computer Programming series. It was initially written as 
	     an attempt to standardize the computer programming practices of the day and was 
	     intended to only take up a single book, but as he wrote it the scope of the work
	     widened and grew into the prolific work that it is today. In addition to its 
	     original intended purpose, the books are often credited with formalizing the 
	     analyses of algorithms and includes the origins of the notation still used to for
	     analyzing algorithms. At one point Knuth even proposed to his publishers changing 
	     the name of the book to The Analyses of Algorithms, which the publishers shot down 
	     under the grounds that nobody would ever buy a book with that name.</p>
	   <p>	Partially motivated by his dislike for the quality of his computer printed 
	     books, Knuth also made contributions to the field of digital typesetting. The 
	     result of this was TeX, a typesetting engine, and METAFONT, a font design system. 
	     This was an ongoing project and Knuth would spend a little over a decade making 
	     changes and improving upon his typesetting engine before giving it up in 1990. 
	     Knuth made his typesetting engine easy to make additions to, and many offshoots 
	     have come from the TeX printing system, with names like LaTeX and ConTeXt. This 
	     would foreshadow the open-source software movement that would make itself felt 
	     in the decades to come.</p>
	   <p>	Knuth once said that <q>Computer programming is an art, because it applies 
	     accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and 
	     especially because it produces objects of beauty. A programmer who subconsciously 
	     views himself as an artist will enjoy what he does and will do it better.</q> I thought 
	     this quote was interesting coming from a man who had enjoyed tremendous influence 
	     over the field of computers and computer programming. This quote shows Donald Knuth 
	     not as a scientist or theorist, but as an actual practitioner and reveals a little 
	     about Knuth's personal relationship with computer programming.</p>
	   <p>	Perhaps more famous than any quote from Knuth himself is a series of quotes from 
	     Bill Gates concerning The Art of Computer Programming. In a newspaper column that Gates 
	     used to write while still at MIT he quipped <q>If you think you're a really good 
	     programmer... read (Knuth's) Art of Computer Programming... You should definitely send 
	     me a resume if you can read the whole thing.</q> This quote was featured on the cover of the 
	     third edition of the first volume of Art of Computer Programming, which further solidified 
	     the book as an industry standard. In the same article Gates goes on to emphasize the 
	     difficulty and dense content of the book, saying <q>It took incredible discipline, and 
	     several months, for me to read it. I studied 20 pages, put it away for a week, and came 
	     back for another 20 pages. If somebody is so brash that they think they know everything, 
	     Knuth will help them understand that the world is deep and complicated.</q></p>
