      <p>A few selected quotes from Donald Knuth, taken from <a 
        href="https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/donald_knuth">BrainyQuote.com</a></p>
      <blockquote>   The most important thing in the programming language 
        is the name. A language will not succeed without a good name. I have 
        recently invented a very good name and now I am looking for a suitable 
        language.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it 
        correct, not tried it.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>There's ways to amuse yourself while doing things and thats 
        how I look at efficency.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>I decry the current tendency to seek patents on algorithms. 
        There are better ways to earn a living than to prevent other people 
        from making use of one's contributions to computer science.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>The hardest thing is to go to sleep at night, when there are so 
        many urgent things needing to be done. A huge gap exists between what we 
        know is possible with today's machines and what we have so far been able 
        to finish.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>The most important thing in the kitchen is the waste paper basket 
        and it needs to be centrally located.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>People who are more than casually interested in computers should 
        have at least some idea of what the underlying hardware is like. Otherwise 
        the programs they write will be pretty weird.</blockquote>
